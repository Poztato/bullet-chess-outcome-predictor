# ðŸ“‚ Dataset Files

### **1. `Average PR.csv`**
- **Purpose:** Stores the first derived variable: **Average Punishment Rating per Game**.
- **Columns:**
  - `game_id` â€“ Unique identifier for each game.
  - `avg_pr` â€“ Average Punishment Rating (PR) for moves with PR > 100.
  - `is_white` â€“ 1 if the player is White, 0 if Black.
  - `result` â€“ Game outcome (1 = Win, 0 = Loss, 0.5 = Draw).
- **Why:** Captures how often and how severely mistakes were punished, reflecting emotional stress.

- **Purpose:** Groups games into sessions based on time proximity (â‰¤15 minutes apart).
- **Columns:**
  - `game_id` â€“ Unique identifier.
  - `sesh_cnt` â€“ Session count (1, 2, 3â€¦ for order in session).
- **Why:** Models fatigue and momentum effects during extended play.

---

### **3. `Game Ratings.csv`**
- **Purpose:** Tracks rating changes within each session.
- **Columns:**
  - `game_id` â€“ Unique identifier.
  - `sesh_cnt` â€“ Session count.
